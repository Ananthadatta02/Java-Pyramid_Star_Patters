# Java-Pyramid_Star_Patters
This Java program prints a pyramid star pattern based on user input. It takes the pyramid size and uses loops to print spaces and stars. The outer loop controls rows, while inner loops handle spaces and stars. Spaces decrease, and stars increase by 2 per row, forming a centered pyramid. The Scanner class enables dynamic input handling.
